The Arquillian Drone provides a simple way how to write functional tests for an application with a web-based user interface. 
Arquillian Drone brings the power of https://code.google.com/p/selenium[WebDriver] into the Arquillian framework. WebDriver provides a language how to communicate with a browser, like filling the forms, navigating on the pages and validating their content.

== Why should I use Arquillian Drone instead of plain WebDriver?
There are many reasons why you want to do that, the most important being:

* Life cycle management of the browser
* Interaction with deployments and containers provided by Arquillian
* Simple usage of multiple browsers in a single test
* Configuration kept on a single place, outside of the Java code
* Fully compatible with the IDE
* Integration with mobile based browsers testing (https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-droidium[Arquillian Droidium])
* Integration of JavaScript test suite execution (https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-extension-qunit[Arquillian QUnit])
* Compatible with WebDriver (Selenium 2), Selenium 1 and Selenium Grids

If you are still not convinced that Arquillian Drone matches your needs, you might have a look at https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-graphene[Arquillian Graphene 2], which is a wrapper on top of WebDriver, goes one step further and provides you a convenient way how to write tests for rich AJAX UIs with an ease, injections for Page Objects and Page Fragments and much more.

== Getting Started

The following example illustrates how Arquillian Drone can be used with WebDriver:

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class WebDriverTest {
 
    static final String USERNAME = "demo";
    static final String PASSWORD = "demo";
 
    @ArquillianResource
    URL contextPath;
 
    @Drone
    WebDriver driver;
 
    /**
     * Creates a testing WAR application
     *
     * @return WebArchive to be tested
     */
    @Deployment(testable = false)
    public static WebArchive createDeployment() {
        return Deployments.createDeployment();
    }
 
    @Test
    @InSequence(1)
    public void login() {
        LoginPage page = new LoginPage(driver, contextPath);
        page.login(USERNAME, PASSWORD);
    }
 
    @Test
    @InSequence(2)
    public void logout() {
        LoginPage page = new LoginPage(driver, contextPath);
        page.logout();
    }
}
----

You need to put following configuration to the pom.xml file of your project:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <!-- Arquillian Core dependencies -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.jboss.arquillian</groupId>
            <artifactId>arquillian-bom</artifactId>
            <version>${version.org.jboss.arquillian}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
        <!-- Arquillian Drone dependencies and WebDriver/Selenium dependencies -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.jboss.arquillian.extension</groupId>
            <artifactId>arquillian-drone-bom</artifactId>
            <version>${version.org.jboss.arquillian.drone}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

<dependencies>
    <!-- To use Arquillian Graphene (2) -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.jboss.arquillian.graphene</groupId>
        <artifactId>graphene-webdriver</artifactId>
        <version>${version.org.jboss.arquillian.graphene2}</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

NOTE: You can use +graphene-webdriver+ dependency chain even if you are willing to use plain WebDriver. 
    Graphene will just bring you more goodies but it does not force you to change a single line of your code

Nevertheless, if you still don't want to add the Graphene dependencies and just use the plain WebDriver, use this Drone dependency chain:
[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.jboss.arquillian.extension</groupId>
        <artifactId>arquillian-drone-webdriver-depchain</artifactId>
        <version>${version.org.jboss.arquillian.drone}</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>

== Building the project

Prerequisites:

* JDK 6 and newer
* Maven 3.0.3 and newer

=== Running test suite

You can use Arquillian Spacelift to gather all the required binaries. Just run:

[source]
----
./gradlew test
----

This will run tests using multiple Arquillian Core versions and _phantomjs_ browser. In case you want to modify 
the behavior, you can specify +-ParquillianCoreVersions=1.1.4+ and +-Pbrowser=phantomjs,firefox+ for instance.
This will run integration test using a cross product of Arquillian Core and browsers defined.

WARNING: Running testsuite this way will modify all _pom.xml_ files in the project. Make sure you have committed all
your changes there first.

==== Manual way to run test suite

Prerequisites:

* running Selenium Server at port 4444, with paths to binaries required for remote browser execution
* installed web browsers you want to test
* you might want to align your layout to be the same as paths to binaries specified within arquillian.xml in _drone-webdriver_ module. Alternatively, you can override properties with 
 +-Darq.extension.${extensionQualifier}.${propertyName}+

In order to start Selenium Server, execute:

[source,bash]
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.53.1.jar -Dphantomjs.binary.path=/path/to/phantomjs.binary -Dwebdriver.ie.driver=/path/to/iedriverserver.binary

Once Selenium Server is running, you can run the tests by:

[source,bash]
mvn clean verify -Dbrowser=${browser}

Where browser has the same value as browser property from _arquillian.xml_ you want to tests (e.g. firefox, chrome, phantomjs, internetExplorer, opera, etc.)

TIP: VNC server instance can be used to let all the browsers pop out in separate display. Just prepend both commands with +DISPLAY=:${display.number}+

=== Releasing new version

Run following commands:

[source,bash]
mvn clean release:prepare release:perform

Make sure that you push the tag, close all issues with given version in JIRA and mark version as released.
